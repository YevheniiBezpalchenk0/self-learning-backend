This is server side code for my PET project. Self learning is learning managment system that allows user to complete and create courses.

To create server side REST API i use Spring Boot framework. Spring Data JPA + Hibernate used to work with object like entities from database. Spring Security used to create jwt authorization.
Junit5 and Mockito used for module, integration testing. Postman for testing API requests. Used Lombok for eazy creation @Setter, @Getter, @NoArgsConstructor @AllArgsConstructor,
@ToString. ModelMapper library to convert models to data transfer objects.
